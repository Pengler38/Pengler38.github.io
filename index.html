  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I'm Preston Engler, a Software Engineer.</p>
  <p>I'm generally interested in modern programming languages and computer graphics.</p>
  <p>
    I went to school at Michigan Technological University and received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I managed to
    graduate Summa Cum Laude, which I'm proud of.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently I work in the Automotive industry doing embedded programming.

  <h3>About the Hello World banner</h3>
  <p>
    The banner at the top of the page is one of my recent projects. I programmed it in Rust
    using <a href="https://wgpu.rs/">wgpu</a>, a graphics API based on WebGPU. It uses wgpu's WebGL backend and compiles
    to wasm to be run on browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The banner uses no assets: The 3d models and textures are fully generated with code I wrote. It was fun to do everything in code
    instead of using outside tools, and it looks nice enough so I'd call it a success.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if you haven't already tried, mouse over the banner and the letters will deform, this works on mobile too.
