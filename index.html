  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p>I'm Preston Engler, a Software Engineer.<br> I like to program.</p>
  <p>I have a mild interest in computer graphics and modern programming languages. Currently I work in the Automotive industry doing embedded programming.</p>
  <h3>About the Hello World banner</h3>
  <p>
    The banner at the top of the page is one of my recent projects; I programmed it in Rust
    using wgpu, a low-level graphics API (between OpenGL and Vulkan). It uses wgpu's webgl backend and compiles to wasm to be run on browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
    It uses zero assets: The 3d models and textures are fully generated with code I wrote. This wasn't the hardest challenge, but it was
    fun to do everything in code instead of using outside tools. After all, the point of the project was coding and experimentation, so I would call it a
    resounding success. Computer graphics is a complicated topic and with enough research and elbow grease, I was able to make it work.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you haven't already tried, mouse over the banner or touch it on mobile and the letters will deform. I spent a good amount of time tweaking
    the numbers and math equations behind the deformations to make it satisfying.
