  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    I'm Preston Engler, a Software Engineer.
    <br>Most of my time programming for school or work has been spent in good old C, though lately in my free time I've been interested in modern programming languages and some computer graphics.</p>
  <p>
    I went to school at Michigan Technological University for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and I currently work in the Automotive industry doing embedded programming.
  </p>
  <h3>About the Hello World banner</h3>
  <p>
    This is a 3D banner I programmed. I wanted to write a flashy and complex project in Rust that worked with graphics libraries at as low of a level as is reasonable.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I'm satisfied with how it turned out! Instead of a higher level library like a game engine or three.js, I used <a href="https://wgpu.rs/">wgpu</a>,
    the Rust implementation of the WebGPU API. It's certainly not the easiest way to get a good looking result, but I learned the most doing it.
  </p>
  <p> Points of interest: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can be built for desktop or WebAssembly to be used on a website (Such as this one).</li>
    <li>You can mouse over the letters and they will deform slightly, showing that it's a running program and not an animation.</li>
    <li>The letter models and letter texture aren't loaded assets, they're generated as the program starts up. The letters are made with handwritten points and a few functions to mirror and duplicate them, while the texture is generated by a simple noise function.</li>
    <li>In the build process I have a build.rs script which counts the number of lines in *.rs files and adds that into the program as a constant, which it can display on the website.</li>
    <li>Power consumption should be low even on mobile devices. The CPU is hardly doing any work after startup and all the runtime complexity is in the vertex and fragment shaders. </li>
  </ul>
